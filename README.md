# Flight Path API

## Overview
Flight Path API is a simple Go web application that reconstructs a flight itinerary from an unordered list of flight tickets. It determines the correct order of flights from the given input and provides a structured travel path.

## Features
- Accepts flight data as JSON input via an HTTP POST request.
- Determines the correct order of travel based on the flight tickets.
- Returns the reconstructed itinerary as a JSON response.
- Uses the Echo framework for HTTP request handling.
- Includes unit tests for core functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- **Go** (Golang) for backend development.
- **Echo** for HTTP request handling.
- **Testing Package** for unit tests.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Go (1.18+)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/katerji/flight-path-go.git
cd flight-path-go
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
go mod tidy
```

### Build the Project
```sh
./build.sh
```

### Run the Application

```sh
go run main.go
```
Alternatively, you could run the executable file generated by ./build.sh

## Usage
### API Endpoint
- **URL:** `POST /find-flight-path`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`
- **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "flights": [
    { "source": "JFK", "destination": "LAX" },
    { "source": "LAX", "destination": "DXB" },
    { "source": "DXB", "destination": "SFO" },
    { "source": "SFO", "destination": "SJC" }
  ]
}
```

- **Response:**

```json
{
  "flight_path": ["JFK", "LAX", "DXB", "SFO", "SJC"],
  "success": true
}
```
